# Product Analytics Diploma Project

This repository contains my diploma project in product analytics. The project focuses on analyzing a dataset from a mobile match-3 game. The dataset includes logs and in-game events.

## Project Overview

As part of the assignment, I performed the following tasks:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Processed raw data, cleaned inconsistencies, and created additional tables by calculating missing metrics.
- **Metrics System Development**: Designed a comprehensive system of key performance indicators (KPIs) to analyze user revenue, conversion rates, and purchase structure.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Built an interactive dashboard to monitor metric changes and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Derived conclusions based on data patterns and provided actionable recommendations.
- **A/B Testing Analysis**: Evaluated the results of an A/B test to determine the impact of reducing level difficulty on player performance and engagement.

## Key Deliverables

- Cleaned and structured dataset
- KPI-based analytical system
- Interactive dashboard
- A/B test analysis report
- Recommendations for game optimization

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, implement analytical frameworks, and drive strategic product decisions based on data insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Statsmodels)
- Tableau / Power BI (for dashboard visualization)
- A/B testing methodologies (proportions_ztest)
